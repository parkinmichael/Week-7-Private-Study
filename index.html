            <h1>Lists</h1>

            <p>A list is a data structure containing elements all of the same data type and you may find duplicates in them. They are an example of a dynamic data structure meaning that their length can change throughout the runtime of a program and it is possible for the structure to'overflow' if it ecceeds the amount of memory that it's allocated.</p>
            <p>One way to implement a list into java is to use the ArrayList function which can be used by importing the ArrayList library. A number of different operations can be performed on an ArrayList. These are shown in the table below.</p>
            <p>The examples are based on the following list with the identifier myList: 45, 66, 41, 13, 19, 8</p>
